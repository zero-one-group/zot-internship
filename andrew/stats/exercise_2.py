Let X and Y be independent N(0, 1) random variables. Let Z = X^2 + Y. Whatâ€™s the expected sample correlation between X and Y? What about X and Z? Elaborate on your findings.

# As both X and Y are generated randomly, we would expect them to have zero correlation. This is shown by calculating the correlation coefficient. Z is calculated from X and Y which have zero correlation, so the correlation coefficient between X and Z should be close to zero too.
